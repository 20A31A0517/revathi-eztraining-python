STACK:
Stack follows LIFO-->Last In First Out
n stack, a new element is added at one end and an element is removed from that end only. 
The insert and delete operations are often called push and pop.
The functions associated with stack are:

empty() – Returns whether the stack is empty – Time Complexity: O(1)
size() – Returns the size of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
top() / peek() – Returns a reference to the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
push(a) – Inserts the element ‘a’ at the top of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
pop() – Deletes the topmost element of the stack – Time Complexity: O(1)
QUEUE:
Queue follows FIFO-->First In First Out
 With a queue the least recently added item is removed first. 
A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
Operations associated with queue are: 
 

Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
Front: Get the front item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)
Rear: Get the last item from queue – Time Complexity : O(1)
