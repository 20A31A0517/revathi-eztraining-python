BINARY TREE:
Binary Tree is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. 
Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children,
 we typically name them the left and right child.
TYPES OF BINARY TREE:
Types of Binary Tree based on the number of children:
1)Full binary tree-->A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children.
2)Degenerate or Pathological tree-->A Tree where every internal node has one child.
3)Skewed binary tree-->A skewed binary tree is a pathological/degenerate tree in which 
the tree is either dominated by the left nodes or the right nodes.
	i)Left skewed binary tree
	ii)Right skewed binary tree

Types of Binary Tree On the basis of the completion of levels:
1)Complete Binary Tree: if all the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level 
and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with two major differences:
Every level must be completely filled
All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
The last leaf element might not have a right sibling i.e. a complete binary tree doesnâ€™t have to be a full binary tree.
2)Perfect Binary Tree:in which all the internal nodes have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. 
3)Balanced Binary Tree:A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes. 

Types of Binary Tree On the basis of node values:
1)Binary Search Tree
2)AVL Tree
3)Red Black Tree
4)B Tree
5)B+ Tree
6)Segment Tree
BINARY TREE TRAVERSAL:
1)In-order traversal   -->Left -Root - Right-->LDR
2)Pre-order traversal -->Root -Left - Right-->DLR
3)Post-order traversal-->Left -Right - Root-->LRD
