LAMBDA FUNCTION:
It is called as anonymous function.When we want to use function concept 
alone without using function name then we apply concept of lambda function.
Ex:
x = lambda a, b: a * b
print(x(5, 6))
Output:30

FOUR PILLARS OF OOPS:
1)Abstraction
2)Encapsulation
3)Inheritence
4)Polymorphism

ABSTRACTION:
Hiding the implementation part and showing what is required for the users is called abstraction.
Ex: .exe file
We can make class or method as abstract ,opposite to abstract is concrete.

ENCAPSULATION:
Binding data and function into a single entity.
Public(low level data protection)-->one class info can be accessed by any other class
Private(medium level)-->can be used where it is declared /no in inherited class 
Protected(high level)-->can be accessed only where it got declared whichever class inhertied from this class there also we can use

INHERITENCE:
Base class and derived class 
Derived class inherits the properties of the bae class
Base class -->parent class
Derived class -->child class

Types of inheritence:
1)Single inheritence 
2)Multiple inheritence
3)Multi level inheritence
4)Hierarchical inheritence
5)Hybrid inheritence

POLYMORPHISM:
